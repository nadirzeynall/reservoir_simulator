# Fully-implicit Python Reservoir Simulator

This code represents a straightforward Python implementation of a fully implicit reservoir simulation, encompassing one-dimensional, two-phase (oil and water), and three-phase (oil, gas, and water) scenarios. 

It is important to note that the code is currently in its nascent stage and requires extensive development to attain a level of maturity suitable for industrial applications.
